  This was my first Deep Learning framework for Python. In this project, I learned a lot of concepts and had a good time. The goal was to make an easy-to-use framework to help other beginners like me to understand how a neural network works, which includes: how to implement, use, create distinct structures for different issues, and efficiently apply the many features it has.

  This was one of my first projects when I really started in Data Science. Written in my native language, I analyzed and compared the COVID-19 data offered by the government and the Brazil elections in 2018, to apply the Newcomb–Benford Law for fraud identification. The purpose of it is only to apply my studies about Numpy,   Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Data Analysis, and Statistics. It was through this project that I understood the potential of Data Science, statistical concepts and that is why this work is very important to me.

  I built this algorithm during my graduation in Universidade Federal de Itajubá as an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence class. This script creates a random Traveling Salesperson Problem and tries to solve it with a Genetic Algorithm. In the end, the algorithm shows the best route and plot it in space.This turned out to be a fun project as well.
